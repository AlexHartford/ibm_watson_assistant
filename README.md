# ibm_watson_assistant

Dart package simplifying integration with [IBM Watson Assistant v2 API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v2).

See the [example project](https://github.com/AlexHartford/ibm_watson_assistant/tree/master/example) for usage.

## Future
Tests would be a welcome contribution.

If I end up using more IBM Watson services in the future, I will likely make another package and consolidate.

This package should remain up-to-date as it's a core dependency of an app I'm working on. Please submit an issue if I miss an update.
