# ibm_watson_assistant

Dart package simplifying integration with IBM Watson Assistant v2 API.

See the [example project](https://github.com/AlexHartford/ibm_watson_assistant/example) for usage.

## Future
Tests would be a welcome contribution.

If I end up using more IBM Watson services in the future, I will likely make another package and consolidate.

This package should remain up-to-date as it's a core dependency of an app I'm working on. Please submit an issue if I miss an update.
